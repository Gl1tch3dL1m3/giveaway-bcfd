# Hello! 👋
I'm a Giveaway bot coded in Bot Commander for Discord. My source code is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Gl1tch3dL1m3/giveaway-bcfd). Feel free to copy and use it in whatever you want!

Everyone can create a giveaway in any channel. Even without an administrator permission. However, everyone with the administrator permission can cancel any giveaway in a server (see ❌ reaction).

**Commands:**
`gw!help` - This message.
`gw!new <prize>` - Creates a new giveaway.
`gw!end` - Ends a giveaway.
`gw!reroll` - Chooses a new winner of an ended giveaway.

🎉 - Join a giveaway
👥 - Sends a list of participants in DM
❌ - Force giveaway cancellation (only admin)

*<> is a required parameter.*
